## Javascript File

Involves:
Connecting to a Firebase database and capturing user inputted data
User can also enter the name and other details of a new train
System will calculate next arrival time and minutes remaining based on user input. 
Any new train information is added to the website. 
The user can delete a train record by clicking on the delete button. 


Challenge I could not reolve - A record is still visible on teh screen after it is deleted. Once page refreshes, then the data disapppers.
